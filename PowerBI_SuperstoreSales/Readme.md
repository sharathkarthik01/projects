# Project Overview

As part of this project, I have created a dashboard to derive and track various KPIs on superstore sales. Managers and business leaders can use 
this dashboard to analyse the top performing states and in-demand products across the country. Additionally, top N filters are provided for 
profit by state, sales by state and sales by sub-category 


# Dashboard KPIs

* **Profit by State** – 
    * The KPI shows the total profit by each state in the country. The Top N filter can be used to only view the N number of states
    * The chart type used is Geo Map. The size of the bubble co-relates to the amount of the profit. 
      > **The observation is that the California has the highest profit**

* **Sales by State** – 
    * The KPI shows determine the total sales by each state in the country. The Top N filter can be used to only view the N number of states
    * The chart Type used is Tree map. The size of the boxes co-relates to the amount of sales
      > **The observation is that the California has the highest sales**

* **Sales by Category** – 
    * The KPI shows the total sales by each product category. With this KPI, it is easy to understand the relative demand of the product categories
    * Dough nut chart is used along with labels to show the total sales & ratios for each product category
      > **The observation is that all product categories are performing equally**

* **Sales by Region** – 
    * The KPI shows the total sales by each region. With this KPI, it is easy to understand which region needs more marketing focus
    * Dough nut chart is used along with labels to show the total sales & ratios for each region
      > **The observation is that the south region is performing poorly and needs more focus**

* **Sales by ship mode** – 
    * The KPI shows the ratios of the shipping mode availed. This KPI helps identify the most desired and least desired shipping mode.
    * Dough nut chart is used along with labels to show the ratios for each shipping mode
      > **The observation is that the same day shipping mode is the least desired and standard shipping mode is the most desired**

* **Sales by Sub-category** – 
    * The KPI shows the total sales by sub-category. This KPI helps identify the best performing product sub-categories. The Top N filter can be used to view only the N number of the sub-categories
    * A bar chart is used with a gradient colouring along with labels showing total sales
      > **The observation is that the Phones and Chairs are the most in-demand sub-categories**
